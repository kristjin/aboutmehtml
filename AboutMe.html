        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Former customer service agent, executive assistant, private chef, and interior designer now taking a swipe
        at writing code.  Based in Seattle, I like writing code that is readable, simple, and clean.  I'm not an expert
        in anything.  I know enough Java to wreck your program.  I'm slow as molasses in January.  But when I do it,
        I take care to do it right, from the start.  I like to write code from the ground up. </p>
        <p>Additionally, I was in court all day, getting a restraining order.  Fun!</p></div>
